- 👋 Hi, I’m Andy
- 👀 I am a logical and creative thinker who enjoys learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies.
- 🌱 Dear JavaScript hater:
      I've had the chance to work professionally with many different programming languages like Java, Python, Rust, C#, and some other boring stuff like VBA.
      But you know what? I always end up going back to using TypeScript/JavaScript and related stuff like React/Next.js for all my projects."I can't help it."
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some Open Source Projects
