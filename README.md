# 👋 Hi, I’m Andy Alfonso

👀 I'm a logical and creative thinker with a passion for learning new languages, frameworks, and technologies. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of programming languages and tools, including:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (My go-to for most projects)
- **Java** (Solid for backend systems)
- **Python** (Great for scripting and data analysis)
- **VBA** (Yeah, even VBA for some Excel wizardry)

🌱 Despite my experience with many different languages, I always find myself coming back to TypeScript/JavaScript, especially when working with React/Next.js. "I can't help it."

💞️ I'm always open to collaborating on Open Source projects.
